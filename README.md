# Thumbnail downscaling tests

## How to run
Run the testing environment in docker...
```bash
docker-compose up --build

Open your browser at `http://localhost:8000` and see what is happening when you go to `fe-downscaling.html` or `be-downscaling.html`. You can look into your developer toolbar in network tab or performance, you know...
